# Find A Room

A mock up of an application for student's to find suitable accommodation.

cd find-a-room
npm init
npm install
http-server
```
Go to localhost:8080

## Technology Choices

I used Foundation for the CSS scaffolding and to help build the responsive elements of the page.  I added a simple server to enable the loading of the different html files for each of the rooms.  I used JQuery to for DOM interactions.
